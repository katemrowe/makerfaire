					<p>We are excited to inform you that your proposal for World Maker Faire, #$post_id - $project_name, has been accepted. Congratulations, we are delighted to have you participate in the 5th Annual World Maker Faire New York 2014.</p>
					<p>Your support and involvement is important to the Maker community, and we thank you in advance for bringing your project, enthusiasm, and Maker spirit to the event.
